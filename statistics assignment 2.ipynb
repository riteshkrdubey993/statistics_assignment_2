    "The mean, median, and mode are different measures of central tendency that provide information about the typical value or center of a dataset. Here's how they differ and how they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and then dividing the sum by the total number of values. It takes into account the magnitude of each value in the dataset. The mean is widely used because it considers all the values and provides a representative average. However, it is sensitive to extreme values, as even a single outlier can significantly impact the mean. The mean is commonly used in many statistical analyses, such as calculating the average score in a test or determining the average income in a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. It is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean, making it a useful measure when dealing with skewed distributions or datasets with outliers. The median divides the dataset into two equal halves, with 50% of the values falling below it and 50% above it. This measure is commonly used when the distribution of data is not symmetrical, such as income distribution or housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It represents the peak or most common value in the distribution. The mode is particularly useful for categorical or discrete data, but it can also be applied to numerical data. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal) if multiple values have the same highest frequency. The mode is often used to describe the most prevalent category in a dataset or to identify the most common response in a survey.\n"

    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how the values in a dataset are distributed around the central tendency. Here's how these measures are used and an example to illustrate their application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. It gives a rough estimate of the spread but doesn't provide information about the distribution of values within that range. For example, if you have a dataset of test scores ranging from 60 to 90, the range would be 90 - 60 = 30, indicating a spread of 30 points between the lowest and highest scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of each value from the mean of the dataset. It quantifies the dispersion by considering the differences between each data point and the mean, taking into account both the direction and magnitude of those differences. A higher variance indicates a greater spread of values. For example, if you have a dataset of ages with a variance of 25, it means that the values deviate, on average, 25 units squared from the mean age.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of dispersion in the original units of the dataset. It is widely used because it is easy to interpret and has desirable mathematical properties. The standard deviation is a more common measure of dispersion than the variance as it shares the same units as the original data. It gives a sense of the average distance between each data point and the mean. For example, if you have a dataset of exam scores with a standard deviation of 10, it indicates that, on average, the scores deviate 10 units from the mean score."

    "\n",
    "Median: The median is not affected by the outlier: it remains the middle value: 90. The median is resistant to the extreme value.\n",
